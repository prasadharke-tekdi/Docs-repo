# Metabase setup installation guide

**Running Metabase on Docker**

To run the matabase on docker you must have docker installed.

Metabase provides an official Docker image via Dockerhub that can be used for deployments on any system that is running Docker.

Visit this link:

```
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
```
Then start the Metabase container:
```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase

```
This will launch an Metabase server on port 3000 by default.

Once startup completes, you can access your Open Source Metabase at http://localhost:3000.

You can create the service using docker comspose file. Just create `docker-compose.yml` file and paste below script

```
